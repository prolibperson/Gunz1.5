# prolib's Gunz1.5 
This source is made by Jetman, but the state it got released in isnt the greatest.
So, since I'm very nice, here is a better "Jetman Source".

Compile this in Release Win32.

Features:

    Achievement system commented out (its unfinished and causes a deathmatch matchserver crash... zz), 

    Quest Fixes from Jetman, 

    Ammo Bar works properly, 

    Medkits fixed, 

    Sword Reload Fix (checks for nullptr unlike my old fix, credits to Lotus), 

    Compiles with C++17, 

    FPS Limiter improvements, 

    Duel Tournament should be functional (make sure to set DB up properly), 

    Damage Counter counts both HP and AP damage, 

    FOV Option, 

    UI Changes, 

    FPS Counter updates every .25 seconds (hopefully), 

    Can read from unpacked MRSES (gets enabled and disabled in config.h),

    UpTimeFaker to fix an uptime related issue,

I probably forgot some stuff I did T-T

shoutout to ini because without her there wouldnt be any ini files
